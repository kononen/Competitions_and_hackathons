1) Team Design Qualifier

Automated HR system 

 In a small company that creates IT solutions for mobile operators, the CEO decides 
to try to partially or completely replace the HR department with an IT system that performs 
its functions.
 He entrusts the development of this to his CTO (technical director), and, following 
the hierarchy of the company, this task falls on the shoulders of a team of technical specialists, 
that is, you.

You are required to:
 1. Make a list of the necessary functionality of the future IT system, describe 
the responsibilities of the HR department in the company.
 2. To propose a concept for the technical implementation of this functionality – 
to develop an IT system that will perform the necessary functions, describe the principles of its 
operation.
 3. Draw conclusions about how possible it is to replace the HR department with an 
IT system that works “without people”.
Evaluation criteria:
 1. The degree of achievement of the goal.
 2. The reasonableness of the functionality – how it corresponds to the tasks of HR 
(item 1 of the task).
 3. The detail of the study of the technical implementation (how well thought out, ready 
to use the IT system).
Comment: An IT system means a complex of any technical means (equipment and programs) 
that perform any functions.
